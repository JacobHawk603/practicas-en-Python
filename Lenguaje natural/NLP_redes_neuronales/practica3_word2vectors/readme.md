# how to run

This original algorythm works with [PokÃ©mon Legends: Arceus - Metacritic Users Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brunovr/pokemonarceus) dataset. Be sure to download and extract the zip file on this directory for running It

You will also need to download this [code](https://github.com/CCogS-Mx/text-preprocessing) from github and extract into this directory.

***By the way, you will also need to rename the directory "test-preprocessing" to "test_preprocessing" because of the syntax from imports on python***

Part of the code that I use here on this repo was obtained from this [tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/continuous-bag-of-words-cbow-in-nlp/) from geeks for geeks.

For this practice, I have modified an algorythm which was also here on this repo, but due to the time I worked on It, It has a lot of issues, so consider It an upgrade for It jejeje, this code, is in fact "manejo_dataset_heartAttack.py", here is the [original](https://github.com/JacobHawk603/practicas-en-Python/blob/main/machine%20learning/Manejo%20de%20Datasets/manejo_dataset_heartAttack.py) if you want to take a look (>w<).

Please consider this last modified algorithm here is not the main class, here, we use this code as a library, so, if you try to compare both codes, the original one will also have a method to make it executable as a main code.

## Important

Make sure to delete .git file from [text_processing](./text_preprocessing) if exist, in other case, this will make problems if you want to commit changes
